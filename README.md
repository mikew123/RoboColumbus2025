Wheeled autonomus robot for 2025 DPRG RoboColumbus competion

This project was started in June 2024 and is expected to have a competitive robot for the RoboColumbus competition in Fall of 2025. I will drive the robot around the field in The Fall of 2024 and maybe have odometry and mapping show on ROS2 Rviz2.

# RoboColumbus competition
The basic objective for RoboColumbus are:
-Three orange cones, designated as home, target, and challenge, are placed
outdoors approximately 100 yards from each other. The course between the home cone and the
target cone is clear of obstacles. The course between the challenge cone to both the home
cone and the target cone contains at least one obstacle that requires the robot to deviate from a
direct path. The challenge is to touch and stop at each cone.
- If multiple contestants find and touch the same number of cones then the total time is used to select the winner.
- Robots run on a field of grasses and some tree/bushes boxes etc for obsticles to avoid. Some pavement is OK.
- GPS coordinates of the 3 traffic cones in the field are provided. There should be obsticals between some of the cones. The owner can create GPS coordinates to avoid obsticles.
- The cones are orange and about 17" high and 7" diameter.
- Robots are NOT allowed on the field before competition.
- Run times are less than 15 Minutes
- Robots checked for weight(65 lbs), size(48x48x60 in), and safety switch compliance.
